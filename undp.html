                      Goal 1: No Poverty

                    <p>
                      NSS NSUT Cell belief that poverty goes beyond income, encompassing
                      the lack of access to basic needs like food, education, and healthcare.
                      Addressing poverty requires empowering marginalized communities
                      and reducing systemic inequalities. Key activities include providing
                      quality education and vocational training to enhance job opportunities
                      and supporting small businesses through microfinance programs.
                      Governments and organizations should also focus on affordable
                      housing, universal healthcare, and robust social protection systems to
                      reduce vulnerabilities. Public awareness campaigns can engage
                      communities in tackling local poverty issues. Collaborative efforts from
                      governments, private sectors, and civil society are essential to achieve
                      inclusive economic growth and ensure that no one is left behind.
                      Together, these initiatives can create sustainable solutions to break the
                      cycle of poverty and build a more equitable future.</p>
